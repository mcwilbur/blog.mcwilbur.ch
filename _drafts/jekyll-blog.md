For while now I played with the idea of publishing a personnal blog to help me keep track of the many things I experiment with. 
It comes with the added benefit of providing some information on different subjects that might be of help to someone, someday.

There are many different blogging tools available for pretty much every programming language that I know of. 
My first choice was to go with a full-fledged MVC framework like Laravel for PHP or Django for Python. 
As I'm pretty lazy and know myself well enough, I didn't want to spend another year goofing around with the tool before starting to write things down.
The next best solution was to create a quick'n dirty bare-bone blogging tool with Express or something similar. 
That's when I stumbled upon Jekyll which offered an interesting concept : a serverless blogging tool which renders static content.
